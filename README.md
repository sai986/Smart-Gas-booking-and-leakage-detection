##Introduction and background of the problem

  In present days, the life of the people has become very busy. In day to day life everything is automated then why not the gas cylinder booking automated ? Moreover, most of the people stand in long queues for booking the gas cylinders.. Can’t this be avoided ? Because of the versatile nature of LPG it is used for many needs such as domestic fuel, industrial fuel, automobile fuel, heating, illumination etc and the demand for LPG is on an exponential rise day by day. Natural gas is another widely used fuel in homes. Both burn to produce clean energy, however there is a serious threat about their leakage. The gases being heavier than air do not disperse easily and may lead to suffocation when inhaled; also the leaked gases when ignited may lead to explosion. The number of deaths due to the explosion of gas cylinders has been increasing in recent years. There is  a need for a system to detect and also prevent leakage of LPG.

So, our main objectives to address the above cited problems are   
1.Keep track of gas usage and its level in cylinder that helps in automatic booking of gas cylinder.  
2.Avoiding long queues while booking of a gas cylinder.  
3.Toxic gas detecting and alerting system.
